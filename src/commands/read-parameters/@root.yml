  This command reads parameters with a specific path prefix from SSM Parameter Store 
  into the $BASH_ENV for CircleCI. This allows you to use these values as environment 
  variables in subsequent steps. For example, if you have a parameter with the name
  "/Project/Upload/ArtifactBucket", this would be set as $PROJECT_UPLOAD_ARTIFACT_BUCKET.

  You can use then use these environment variables in later steps, as demonstrated
  in the cloudformation/package-template example below.

  To generate the variable key, we replace all slashes with underscores, 
  strip any "special characters" ("-" for example) and 
  convert camel-case to snake-case.
